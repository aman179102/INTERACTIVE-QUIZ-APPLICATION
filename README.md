This Interactive Quiz Application is a fully responsive, feature-rich web application built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, without relying on any external libraries or frameworks. Developed in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), the project emphasizes clean code architecture, smooth animations, and a polished user experience. The quiz dynamically loads questions based on selected difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard, or All), tracks user scores, provides instant feedback, and ensures seamless navigation across all devices.

Key Features
